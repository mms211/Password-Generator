# Password-Generator

## Description

This random-password generator was created to create passwords that are randomly generated based on the criteria of the user. This criteria includes:

- password length (8-128 characters)
- inclusion of lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters and/or numbers

There is also a function to copy the pasword to clipboard.
